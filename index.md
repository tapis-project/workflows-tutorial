## Workshop Introduction
Presenters: 
* Nathan Freeman (TACC)
* Anagha Jamthe (TACC)

The resources you will be using today are provided by funding from the National Science Foundation:

* [Jetstream](https://jetstream-cloud.org/) is a cloud service for research that provides on-demand, user-controled, Virtual Machines (VMs) - you can request and account after the workshop using these [instructions](https://iujetstream.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JWT/pages/76150553/Get+a+Jetstream+Trial+Access+account).  

You should have recieved a paper with a training account for Jetstream Virtual Machine(VM) IP with username and password for that VM.  These are the credentials that we will use today and are only valid for todays workshop.

The Jetstream VMs all have the same configuration running Ubuntu 18 with all required software (Docker, Singularity).
