### What is a Tapis app? 
A Tapis application represents all the information required to run a Tapis job on a Tapis system and produce useful results. Each application is versioned and is associated with a specific tenant and owned by a specific user who has special privileges for the application. In order to support this purpose an application definition includes information which allows the Jobs service to:

* Stage input prior to launching the application

* Launch the application

* Monitor the application during execution

* Archive output after application execution
