Lecture: Introduction to the Jupyter Notebook Environment
===


Jupyter is an open source project that provides a webapp interface for writing code and documents. Throughout this tutorial, we will be using a Jupyter Notebook environment for development. 

### Starting up your Jupyter Notebook Environment

For this tutorial, we will use TACC Jupyterhub. Log into https://jupyter.tacc.cloud using your TACC credentials. 

Once you open a browser with your Jupyter environment, you can select the image "taccsciapps/jupyteruser-base:0.1.11" from the list and click on "Start my server"

### Creating a Notebook

To create a new notebook for writing code, start by clicking 'New' in the upper right corner. From here, you will be able to choose what type of notebook you want. For this tutorial, we will be using Python 3. 

Once you open a notebook, you can write and run python code. To execute a line of code, press `shift + Enter`.
