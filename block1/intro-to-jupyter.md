Introduction to the Jupyter Notebook Environment
===


Jupyter is an open source project that provides a webapp interface for writing code and documents. Throughout this tutorial, we will be using a Jupyter Notebook environment for making Tapis User Requests. 

### Starting up your Jupyter Notebook Environment

For this tutorial, we will use [TACC Jupyterhub](https://jupyter.tacc.cloud) using your TACC credentials. 

Once you open a browser with your Jupyter environment, you can select the image "taccsciapps/jupyteruser-base:0.1.11" from the list and click on "Start my server"
