    "# Using tapipy to Create Tapis Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore the `tapipy` library's support for executing actor containers on the TACC Abaco Cloud. This tutorial assumes the user has a TACC account and access to the TACC Cloud APIs via a set of OAuth API keys. Full details on getting the required accounts can be found on Abaco's Getting Started Guide here: https://abaco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/index.html#account-creation-and-software-installation\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tapipy` library is a Python library for interacting with TACC's Tapis API platform. It can be installed directly from PyPI using pip - `pip install tapipy`.\n"

    "## Importing and Instantiating the Tapis object\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary functionality is accessed through a Tapis client, a Python object containing methods for accessing the primary APIs within the Tapis framework. The first step is to import and instantiate one of these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When instantiating the `Tapis` object, we must provide the `api_server` to interact with. This is because Tapis is a multi-tenant platform and serves different projects at different base URLs. To interact with the primary \"TACC\" tenant, use `api_server=https://api.tacc.utexas.edu`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to supply the `Tapis` constructor with some authentication credentials. Here we have several options, the simplest of which is to just provide an OAuth access token via the `token` parameter. You can also provide a TACC `username` and `password`, together with an `api_key` and `api_secret` and use the `Tapis` object to generate an access token. For now, we'll just assume we have an access token already."
